# Nanotechnology-and-Machine-Learning


**Product Mission:**

Our mission is to conduct research to discover ways in which machine learning can be used in conjunction with nanotechnology to discover and improve cancer prediction and diagnosis methodologies. Through the exploration of this area, our goal is to contribute to the field of cancer research by understanding how nanotechnology is currently used in the field and how machine learning can be used to improve the current capabilities of nanotechnology.

<br />

**Minimum Viable Proudct:**

As a user, I want to:

-	Be able to use the designed ML model in skin cancer detection.

-	Explore how nanotechnology is used in cancer prediction and diagnosis. 

-	Design theoretical experiments using different nanotechnologies and integrate them with the designed ML model.

<br />

Our MVP is to design a basic ML model for skin cancer detection, followed by researching different ways in which we can use our ML model with nanotechnology. This involves the exploration of current methods which utilize nanotechnology in cancer prediction and diagnosis, and selecting which pieces of nanotechnology we would like to use in our own study. Following this, we will attempt to design theoretical experiments using our ML model and specific pieces of nanotechnology. 

<br />

**Technologies:**

- Machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised)
- Nanotechnology (emphasis on detection and imaging) - Carbon Nanotubes
- Datasets - Kaggle
- Project MONAI (open-source framework)
